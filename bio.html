            <h1>Delfine Paolini – Writer/Director/Producer</h1>

            <p>
            Delfine Paolini is a Bronx-based writer, director, and visual artist whose films explore thanatological themes through psychological realism and painterly imagery. Her work is defined by stillness, restraint, and close observation—stories that examine fragile interior lives and the moral consequences of love, loss, and survival.
            </p>

            <p>
            Before filmmaking, Delfine came up through New York’s downtown arts and punk scenes as a photographer, apprenticing with legendary rock photographer Mick Rock. That early DIY ethos—resourceful, handmade, and fiercely independent—continues to shape her approach to cinema. She builds films the way she once built zines and photo series: intimate, tactile, and emotionally direct.
            </p>

            <p>
            Her debut feature, <em>A Wonderful Way with Dragons</em>, was produced on a microbudget, won over 55 international awards, and successfully recouped its costs, establishing her as both a disciplined producer and a distinctive auteur voice in independent film.
            </p>

            <p>
            She is the founder of LRO Productions, LLC &amp; Le Rouge Films, LLC, and is currently developing an interconnected slate of features including <em>Le Rouge Originel</em>, <em>Reds Hearten</em>, and <em>Sky, Zyprexa, Night</em>.
